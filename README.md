# Python Projects

In this repository, I will be documenting all of the progress I make as I continue to learn and grow my Python programming skills.

For example:

One of the projects you'll find here is a Python script where I'm attempting to implement the classic card game "Skat."
The game is being developed using the Pygame library, which provides an excellent platform for building games and handling multimedia in Python.
